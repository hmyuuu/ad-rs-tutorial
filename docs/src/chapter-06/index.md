# Practical Examples

This chapter walks through real-world applications of automatic differentiation, from simple scalar functions to neural network layers.

You'll see:

- Scalar functions (sin, polynomials)
- Vector operations (dot product, norms)
- Loss functions (MSE, cross-entropy)
- Neural network layer gradients
- Complex composed functions
- Quantum optimal control

Each example includes complete code that you can run from the `examples/` directory.
