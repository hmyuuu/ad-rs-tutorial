# Understanding Automatic Differentiation

Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a technique for computing derivatives of functions expressed as computer programs. It's neither numerical differentiation (finite differences) nor symbolic differentiation (algebraic manipulation) — it's something more powerful.

In this chapter, you'll learn:

- What automatic differentiation is and why it matters
- How AD differs from numerical and symbolic approaches
- The two modes of AD: forward and reverse
- When to use each mode

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand the theoretical foundation that makes Rust's `#[autodiff]` attribute possible.
