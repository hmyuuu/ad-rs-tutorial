# Forward Mode

Forward mode automatic differentiation computes derivatives alongside the primal computation, propagating tangents from inputs to outputs.

In this chapter, you'll learn:

- How to use forward mode with `Forward` and `Dual` annotations
- When forward mode is more efficient than reverse mode
- Computing directional derivatives and Jacobian-vector products
